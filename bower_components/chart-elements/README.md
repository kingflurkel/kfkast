# chart-elements

An element set that leverages [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)


## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower
    
Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install
    

## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can view your element's files under
`http://localhost:8080/components/seed-element/`, where `seed-element` is the
name of the directory containing it.
